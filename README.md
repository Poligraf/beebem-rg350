## Create Distributable
* After building the '`beebem`' binary, you then need to package for RG350 as an OPK file
To make the OPK:
`cd dist`
`./make_opk.sh`


## Installation
To install package onto the RG350...

* Copy beebem.opk to `/media/sdcard/APPS/` folder

* Running beebem at least once will create the ~/.beebem/roms if not already present on your device.
* Put ROMs with _exactly_ these names into ~/.beebem/roms
`'acorn_dnfs'` - Acorn DNFS 1.2 (chip ID# 201666)
`'os12'`       - Base operating system for BBC Model B (v1.2)
`'basic'`      - BBC Basic Programming Language (v2)

## Usage
* Put Disk Images, for example SSD files, e.g. into /media/sdcard/ROMS/BEEB/
